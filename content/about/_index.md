## why? ##
These informations are very useful in cases you need to estimate how much filament is left.

## how to contribute? ##
First, let me say we are gratefull for you even considering helping the community.
Setting time aside in these busy times just for sake of contributing something to
people you don't know is worth applause.

### tl;dr I know git and github, don't delay me ##
Create a pull request to the main branch of the repo https://github.com/jtrmal/spoolz
Your Pull request should contain two files:
  * jpeg photo of the spool in spoolz-photos/
  * description of the spool in spoolz-text/.  Use one of the existing
    files as a template and rename it. The filename is not very important
    but try to make it self-explanatory. Inside the file, change the
    fields
      - title (identification of the spool)
      - image (retain the path and add modify the filename itself)
      - add text/info after the characters '+++'
 * that's it!

### I know how to create "Issue" on github ##
  * please include screenshot of the spool
  * Into the issue text add the following info that is not visible on the picture of the spool
    - filament producer and name
    - filament advertised weight
    - suggested printing temperatura
    - suggested bed temp
    - spool width/height (in mm)
    - spool outer diameter (in mm)
    - spool hole diameter (in mm)
    - any interesting/important info

### I know discord ##
Contact user yendaaa on Voron or Armchair Engineering discord. You will be asked to provide the aforementioned info
so no harm in having it prepared :)
