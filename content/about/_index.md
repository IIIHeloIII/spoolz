## how to contribute? ##
First, let me say we are gratefull for you even considering helping the community.
Setting time aside in these busy times just for sake of contributing something to
people you don't know is worth applause.

### tl;dir I know github, don't delay me ##
Create a pull request to the main branch of the repo https://github.com/jtrmal/spoolz
Your Pull request should contain two files:
  * jpeg photo of the spool in spoolz-photos/
  * description of the spool in spoolz-text/.  Use one of the existing
    files as a template and rename it. The filename is not very important
    but try to make it self-explanatory. Inside the file, change the
    fields
      - title (identification of the spool)
      - image (retain the path and add modify the filename itself)
      - add text/info after the characters '+++'
 * that's it!
